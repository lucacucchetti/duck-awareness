## Dev Instructions

This project uses AWS CDK so it needs NodeJS, I recommend using [nvm](https://nvm.sh/) to manage your node version.

We will be using Node version 16 (latest LTS at this time).

```
nvm use 16

node --version

# v16.16.0
```

We will use AWS CDK to manage infrastructure easily.

```
npm install -g aws-cdk


```
